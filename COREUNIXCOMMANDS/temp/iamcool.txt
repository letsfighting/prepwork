To do this exercise you're going to do some work using the commands you know so far. You'll also need a text editor that can make plain text (.txt) files. Here's what you do:

    Open your text editor and type some stuff into a new file. On OSX this could be TextWrangler. On Windows this might be Notepad++. On Linux this could be gedit. Any editor will work.
    Save that file to your desktop and name it test.txt.
    In your shell use the commands you know to copy this file to your temp directory that you've been working with.
