EVE University is a corporation in EVE Online and a member of the Ivy League Alliance. We are a neutral, non-profit training corporation in New Eden. Founded in March of 2004 by Morning Maniac, EVE University has taught over 25,000 pilots and continues to take new pilots and train them in all aspects of EVE Online. EVE University and the Ivy League Alliance have no presence within the offshoot mobile game EVE Echoes


As well as the UniWiki, EVE University runs classes on various subjects, the majority of which are open to the public both live and in our Class Library. Our calendar has details of our upcoming classes and other events.


EVE University accepts applications from anyone, regardless of SP, who wants to learn more about EVE Online. We are also interested to hear from those who would like to teach or provide content for our members. See our page on Applying to EVE University.


By becoming a member you gain access to our members-only resources, which include our Mentor Program, Corporation Hangars, Skillbook Reimbursement and +3 Implants Program. You also have access to our Student Advocates to help you resolve any issues. As a member you are also eligible to join our Campuses, through which you can experience life in high sec, low sec, null sec and wormholes, as well as incursions and our mining campus.

Note: EVE University is relocating the high sec, low sec and mining campus to Stacmon and Slays in the coming few months. Our null sec, wormholes and incursions communities are not affected by this move.
